      <h1>Economic Growth and Fighting Climate Change are Not Mutually Exclusive </h1>
      <h3>(We Graham do it all!)</h3>

      <p style="padding: 0 10em 2em 0 ">Last summer, Senator Lindsay Graham, Republican from South Carolina, 
            said, “I don’t want to be lectured about what we need to do to destroy our 
            economy in the name of climate change.” (New York Times 2022). 
            Well, Senator Graham, neither do we - because, that’s not what we have to do. </p>

          In 2016, the United States had a GDP of $49,725 and a total ecological footprint
           (human resource demand in global hectares) of 8.22 - one of the highest in the 
           world, behind only Australia and Qatar. However, there are several other 
           countries with an equivalent (or higher) GDP and a lower total ecological 
           footprint. Sweden comes in with a GDP of $59.381 and a footprint of 7.25. 
           Ireland and Austria have GDP similar to the US and footprints nearly 3 global 
           hectares less. Switzerland and Norway also have similarly low footprints, and 
           GDPs even higher than the US. But do the people in these countries with lower 
           ecological footprints enjoy a high standard of living?
        </section>

        <section>
          Yes, they do. This is measured by the WHO’s Human Development Index (HDI),
           which is comprised of three metrics for wellbeing: health, knowledge, and 
           standard of living (WHO). While HDI can be useful for analysis, it is an 
           aggregate metric and therefore does not account for in-country inequalities. 
           In 2016, the United States had an HDI of 0.91 and one of the highest total 
           ecological footprints among countries with similar HDIs. Japan, Italy, Israel, 
           the Netherlands, Cyprus all have HDIs comparable to the United States with 
           significantly lower total ecological footprints. Among GDP peers, Canada is in 
           a similar spot as the United States as Sweden leads with a much lower footprint.
            Australia lags behind with a higher total footprint.
         </section>

         <section>
          Total ecological footprint is challenging to compare against other countries because 
          countries are different sizes, as well as populations. When we standardize both
          country size (biocapacity) and population density we can see that it is possible
          by example that countries of all different sizes can have a positive biocapacity.
          We are not saying that all of these countries are perfect, 
         </section>

         <section>
          Let’s take a closer look at these four countries we’ve been following. 
          This radar plot allows us to consider all of the variables we’ve discussed at 
          once. Clearly, the United States could become more sustainable without 
          sacrificing its GDP or, what’s maybe more relevant for the average person, 
          its human development index. When politicians use fear tactics to pit climate 
          change against our own wellbeing, they are ignoring the potential for sustainable 
          development that other countries are working to achieve.
